                <p>Landlords in New York City are legally required to address rat infestations in their properties as soon as they are reported. If your landlord is refusing to do anything about a rat problem, the city encourages you to report the matter through 311, either <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/" target="_blank">online</a> or by calling 3-1-1. Inspectors from the city's Health Department will then conduct an inspection. If rats are found, your landlord will be ordered to address the issue within a minimum of five days. Landlords that fail to comply can face steep fines, and may be billed directly for abatement services conducted by the city on their behalf. More information on what happens after you file a complaint can be found <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/rats/2021/what-happens-to-your-rat-complaint.pdf" target="_blank"></a>here</a>.

                  <p>Rats thrive where garbage is easily accessible to them. You can reduce the likelihood of a rat infestation by ensuring all garbage cans have tight-fitting lids, and by bringing garbage to the curb as close to pick up time as possible. Garbage left on the curb for too long attracts rats. For apartment residents, make sure to tie your garbage bags securely before throwing them down the garbage chute. 

                  Keep both indoor and outdoor environments free of cllutter and litter that can provide rats with  shelter. Remove piles of newspapers, paper bags, carboard and bottles that may be piling up, and keep weeds and shrubs around your home under control. 

                  A full guide to preventing rat infestations can be found <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/pest/rodent_control.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
